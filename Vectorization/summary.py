# SUMMARY OF BROADCASTING AND VECTORIZATION IN NUMPY
# BROADCASTING: A technique that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes in a way that makes them compatible for element-wise operations. It "stretches" the smaller array across the larger one without making actual copies of data, enabling efficient computation.

# VECTORIZATION: The process of replacing explicit loops with array operations in NumPy. It leverages optimized C and Fortran libraries under the hood to perform operations on entire arrays at once, leading to significant performance improvements.
